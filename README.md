# Portfolio

My name is Callum Ferguson and this repository will act as my portoflio to showcase my education, experience, projects and goals/interests and somewhere to display my opinions on stuff.

# What will be contained in contained in this file?

I hope to fill this portoflio with different projects I complete during the year as well as any extracuricular activities I complete that would showcase my skills as well as any goals or interests I can work towards or pursue in the future.

# Interests

I would like to consider myself a creative person and honestly tend to prefer anything more artistic-based over simple, mundane, slop work. I like to make my work look visually pleasing and maybe due to some OCD, need things to look how I imagine them, or I will consider it a failure...

Like most people I'm sure, I want to see my visions realised in full and I want people to enjoy what I can create. For this reason I have always been drawn to the idea of creating games or animations. I think video games encapsulate a beautiful balance of coding and art that can bring stories and worlds to life. Many indie game developers start with little to no budget and learn everything through online tutorials yet their artistic passion to see their project through tends to lead to some of the msot life-changing game experiences.

I personally find online tutorials annoying as I like to be able to ask questions when I care about a project. I want to know what I'm doing is correct so I don't have to go back over myself. I would very much like to get into IADT's new Game Design course as they teach many of the principles of designing games as well as going over the artistic, logistic and computing side of game development. This would be fantastic as I enjoy having a physcial teacher I can query while I work and learn about game designing software like Unreal Engine or Godot.
